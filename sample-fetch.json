To help keep your code running, I automatically replaced `var sys = require('sys')` with `var util = require('util')`.\n\nIf you'd like to know more about these changes in node.js, take a look at https://github.com/joyent/node/commit/1582cf#L1R51 and https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/1582cfebd6719b2d2373547994b3dca5c8c569c0/ChangeLog#L51 and http://blog.jit.su/introducing-blakmatrix-and-migratorbot .\n\nAs for myself, I was written by your friendly neighborhood node ninjas at [Nodejitsu](http://nodejitsu.com), and you can find them at #nodejitsu on irc.freenode.net or with http://webchat.jit.su .\n\nEnjoy!\n\n--[migrationBot](https://github.com/blakmatrix/node-migrator-bot)"

If the calls are made elsewhere in the tree then they will just be replaced with 0. For example, the following boolean expression:\r\n\r\n    console.log(\"a\") && console.log(\"b\")\r\n\r\nwill be compressed to:\r\n\r\n    0&&0\r\n\r\nAlso, the function arguments will be removed so users should be aware that if an argument is a function call, it won't be executed. For example, the `foo` function call will be totally removed in the following example:\r\n\r\n    console.log(\"this is bad\", foo())\r\n\r\n\r\nThis can be executed from the commandline by adding the `--no-console` flag"
